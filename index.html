        <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>

       <ul>
            <h3>Verse 1: <br> </h3>Never thought about a day that I'll be needin' more
Of this feelin' I can't hide it to you anymore
The way you look the way you move you heatin' up the floor
Babe you got that somethin' special knockin' on my door </br>

        <h3>Chorus:</h3> Oh woah
           Baby you know (baby you know)
           Know I can't control (know I can't control)
           Can't handle this feelin' babe
           Stop teasin' me
           No I ain4't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)</br>

           <h3>Verse 2:<br></h3>See I just wanna let you know that I don't wanna see you go
           Go ahead and leave me hangin' wishin' yearnin' for some more
           I don't wanna lie gustong mahawakan palagi mga kamay (yeah)
           Ang makasama ka 'di ko na mahihintay
           So I should go I should go to you </br>
           
           <h3> Chorus:</h3>
           Baby you know (baby you know)
           Know I can't control (know I can't control)
           Can't handle this feelin' babe
           Stop teasin' me
           No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)</br> 
           
           <h3>Verse 3:<br>Lately I can't go to sleep (uh)
           Thinking 'bout you at night but honestly (uh)
           Baby you're my remedy
           For all the pain that's hurtin' me</h3>
           
           <h3> Chorus: </h3>
           Baby you know (baby you know)
           Know I can't control (know I can't control)
           Can't handle this feelin' babe
           Stop teasin' me
           No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)</br>
           
           <h3> Chorus: </h3>
           Baby you know (baby you know)
           Know I can't control (know I can't control)
           Can't handle this feelin' babe
           Stop teasin' me
           No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)</br>
